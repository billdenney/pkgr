# R6 -- Ensure a user package can be installed from local, ensure repo-order is respected when installing user packages.
# ellipsis -- Ensure a user package can be installed from remote (all deps from remote)
# rlang -- Ensure a dependency package can be installed from remote (dep. of ellipsis)
# openssl -- Ensure that a user package can be installed from remote
# askpass -- Ensure repo order is respected when installing dependencies (askpass is a dependency of openssl. Openssl is installed from second repo, askpass should be installed from first repo.)
# sys -- Ensure a dependency package can be installed from local
