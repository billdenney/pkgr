# Options for Logging
# Without any options set, Pkgr will only log Info-level (and above) messages
# to the standard output device..
# To save logs to a file, use the "all" (as in "log all too").
# To save logs from the "pkgr install" command to a separate file, use the
# "install" option.
# By default, log files will be appended to each time a pkgr is run. If you would
# like the log files to be overwritten instead, set the "overwrite" option to true.
Logging:
  all: logs/all.log
  install: logs/install.log
