# CRAN-Like Repositories from which packages will be downloaded.
# The order that the repositories are listed in matters: Pkgr will look for
# each package in the first repository listed. If a package is not found in the
# first, Pkgr will check the second, then the third, etc.
# first repository listed for each

# Options for Logging
# Without any options set, Pkgr will only log Info-level (and above) messages
# to the standard output device..
# To save logs to a file, use the "all" (as in "log all too").
# To save logs from the "pkgr install" command to a separate file, use the
# "install" option.
# By default, log files will be appended to each time a pkgr is run. If you would
# like the log files to be overwritten instead, set the "overwrite" option to true.
